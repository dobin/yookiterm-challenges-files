# Yookiterm Challenge Files

The source code of vulnerable programs and their corresponding exploit for Yookiterm.

The corresponding challenges / writeups are available at: https://github.com/dobin/yookiterm-challenges

It is served at: https://exploit.courses

The content consists of challenges and homework, in the areas of debugging,
vulnerable programs (Stack- and Heap overflows), corresponding Exploits and
vulnerable ARM programs.

It is intended to run in Ubuntu 16.04, and depending on the challenge, on the correct architecture
(32 or 64 bit). Some care has been taken so that the examples can adequately compile on 
64 Ubuntu 18.04 (adding `-m32` to compile as 32 bit where appropriate, and added `-no-pie`).


## What is yookiterm

terminal, and accompagning tutorials and writeups of
certain topics. It is currently used as a plattform
